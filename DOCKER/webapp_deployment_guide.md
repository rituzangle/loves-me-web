## üîê 4. Share via Docker on Local Network (LAN)

### Create `Dockerfile` in project root:

```Dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY dist/ /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### Build and run:

```bash
docker build -t loves-me-app .
docker run -d -p 8080:80 loves-me-app
```

### Access:

- On your Mac: `http://localhost:8080`
- On LAN (from another device): `http://<your-mac-ip>:8080`

> Find your IP with: `ipconfig getifaddr en0`

You can now share this URL with your tester üöÄ
